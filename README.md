# ADHD-TaskManagementPanel (Still in Development)
Task management fundamentally ensures focused work, better time usage and less procrastination, while aiding memory, boosting efficiency, promoting deadline adherence, tracking goal progression and reducing stress. It's a universal tool beneficial for all, including those with ADHD and without.

# Plans

I plan to create a Android App to also interact with the interface to communicate with a custom backend for managing the tasks list. As of right now the task list isn't presistant so if you wanna leave the page and go back all of your saved entries will be gone so having a backend to store within a db or local using json while also having the ability to import task lists to different instnaces. Multi-user Support will be added so that will include authentication additions, this is really a rough idea of how I plan it to function but if anyone wants to make a issues request for ideas you are very welcome to do so ðŸ˜„ and is much appreciated for that!

# Setup Instructions

* You'll need a machine that can run Nodejs preferably capable of running the latest stable version of Nodejs with NPM, Git, x64 or x86 machine (I have not tested this project on a arm64, or arm7 machine)
* At least 1gb (possibly less can run this project not tested) of available ram is required to run this project
* As of now the project size with all of the packages installed is exactly 268.9Â MB and can get bigger overtime. I recommend at least 1gb of storage space for this project even though its less than that amount only for wiggle room incase the project size increases.

To start you'll want to clone the repo using "git clone https://github.com/greengeckowizard/ADHD-TaskManagementPanel" then you'll wanna cd into the directory by using "cd ADHD-TaskManagementPanel" when you're in the directory now you'll need to hop into the actual project directory for the web instance which is adhdpanel so type "cd adhdpanel". Now you'll need to install the prerequisite packages so type npm install and to run the panel you'll need to type "npm start" however it will not start the backend, so you'll need to open a new terminal instance in your ssh or local term to start the backend which can be ran from inside the backend directory using the "node main" command which will run on port 5000.
