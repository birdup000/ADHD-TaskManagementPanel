- **AI Subtask Generation:** The `AISubtaskGenerator` component suggests subtasks for a given task, leveraging AI.
- **Tutorial:** A `Tutorial` component is included to guide users on how to use the application.
- **Task Details Drawer:** The `TaskDetailsDrawer` component likely displays detailed information about a selected task.
- **Subtask Parsing:** The `SubtaskParser` component is likely used to parse subtasks from user input.
- **AI Task Check-in:** An `AITaskCheckin` component is included to provide AI-assisted task progress updates.
- **AI Task Scheduler:** An `AITaskScheduler` component is available for AI-assisted task scheduling.
- **Notification System:** A `NotificationSystem` component is implemented to manage and display notifications related to tasks.
- **Calendar:** A `Calendar` component for visualizing tasks and schedules.

The project is structured with the following directories:

- `app`: Contains the main application layout (`layout.tsx`) and the main page (`page.tsx`), as well as the analytics feature.
- `components`: Contains reusable UI components such as `TaskPanel`, `FocusTimer`, `Reminders`, `AISubtaskGenerator`, `Tutorial`, `TaskDetailsDrawer`, `AITaskCheckin`, `AITaskScheduler`, `NotificationSystem`, `Calendar`, `RecurringTaskManager`, and `BottleneckForecast`.
- `hooks`: Contains custom hooks like `useAISubtaskGenerator`, `usePredictiveAnalytics`, and `useSchedulingEngine`.
- `lib`: Contains utility files, such as `puter.ts`, `prompt-templates.ts`, and `task-templates.ts`.
- `types`: Contains type definitions, such as `ai-responses.d.ts`, and `SubTask.ts`.
- `public`: Contains static assets such as images and icons.

The project also includes configuration files such as `next.config.ts`, `package.json`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and `tsconfig.json`.
