# ADHD-TaskManagementPanel (Still in Development)

Task management is a fundamental skill that ensures focused work, better time usage, and reduced procrastination. It also aids memory, boosts efficiency, promotes deadline adherence, tracks goal progression, and reduces stress. While a universal tool beneficial for all, it can be especially helpful for individuals with ADHD and other neurodivergent conditions.

This project aims to create a task management panel tailored to the needs of neurodiverse individuals, while also being useful for neurotypical users. The goal is to develop a comprehensive solution that addresses the unique challenges faced by those with ADHD, such as difficulty with focus, organization, and time management.

# Why This Project?

Mental health is an important consideration for everyone, and individuals with ADHD or other neurodivergent conditions often face additional challenges in their daily lives. This project was born out of the recognition that a task management tool specifically designed for neurodiverse users could be a game-changer in helping them achieve their goals and improve their overall well-being.

By creating an open-source application, the project aims to provide a transparent and accessible solution that can be customized and improved upon by the community. The code will be available for review, ensuring users can understand what is running and have confidence in the application.
