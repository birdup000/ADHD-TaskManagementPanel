# Q/A
1.Why are you committed into making this project succesful?
I'm commited because as an individual have ADHD and its hard to focus in general also tis why progress in the project may be slow. 


# Setup Instructions
To start you'll want to clone the repo using "git clone https://github.com/greengeckowizard/ADHD-TaskManagementPanel" then you'll wanna cd into the directory by using "cd ADHD-TaskManagementPanel" when you're in the directory now you'll need to hop into the actual project directory for the web instance which is adhdpanel so type "cd adhdpanel". Now you'll need to install the prerequisite packages so type npm install and to run the panel you'll need to type "npm start" however it will not start the backend, so you'll need to open a new terminal instance in your ssh or local term to start the backend which can be ran from inside the backend directory using the "node main" command which will run on port 5000.
