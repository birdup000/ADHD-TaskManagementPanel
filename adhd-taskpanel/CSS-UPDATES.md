# CSS Updates and Theme System

The CSS system has been updated with the following improvements:

1. **Theme System**
   - Implemented a comprehensive color system with CSS variables
   - Added support for light and dark modes
   - Includes primary, secondary, accent, and feedback colors
   - Proper gray scale palette

2. **Component Styling**
   - All components now use theme colors
   - Consistent focus states and ring offsets
   - Dark mode support for all components
   - Added semantic color variants for buttons

3. **Structure**
   - Organized CSS imports in proper order:
     1. Tailwind directives
     2. Theme styles
     3. Base styles
     4. Component styles

4. **Usage**
   To use the theme colors in your components:
   ```jsx
   // Use primary color
   className="bg-primary text-white"
   
   // Use variants
   className="bg-primary-light hover:bg-primary-dark"
   
   // Use semantic colors
   className="bg-success text-white"
   
   // Use with opacity
   className="bg-primary/20"
   ```

5. **Dark Mode**
   - Set to 'class' mode for better control
   - Add 'dark' class to html/body for dark mode
   - Colors automatically adjust
